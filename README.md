# CUB Engine and Test Stand Development
## General
BEARS is a student initiative located at the Technical University of Berlin, focussing on space projects. Our members are students in aerospace engineering and related fields. Our projects include rovers, rockets, scientific projects and the development of liquid rocket engines.

## About CUB
The CUB engine is the first rocket in development at our student club. It is a cryogenic, biliquid, pressure fed rocket engine using Ethanol and liquid Oxygen. It utilizes an ablative cooling method and a co-axial swirl injector. It aims to deliver 750 newtons of thrust at a chamber pressure of 30 bars.

## About the Test Stand
The test stand is specifically designed to support the CUB engine, but will also support engines up to thrust of 3 kilonewtons. It is a nitrogen pressurized system with two lines. The ethanol and LOX tanks are pressured at 40 bars. 

## About this Repository
At this time, this repository is used as an development repository for our student team. All documents are work in progress and subject to change. All people are welcome to review our work if interested and get in contact with us.
